    "\n",
    "**Canny edge detection** is the most widely-used edge detector. For many of the applications that require edge detection, Canny edge detection is sufficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Canny edge detection has the following three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gradient calculations:**  Edges are pixels where intensity changes abruptly. From previous modules, we know that the magnitude of gradient is very high at edge pixels. Therefore, gradient calculation is the first step in Canny edge detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-maxima suppression:** In the real world, the edges in an image are not sharp. The magnitude of gradient is very high not only at the real edge location, but also in a small neighborhood around it. Ideally, we want an edge to be represented by a single, pixel-thin contour. Simply thresholding the gradient leads to a fat contour that is several pixels thick.\n",
    "      Fortunately, this problem can be eliminated by selecting the pixel with maximum gradient magnitude in a small neighborhood (say 3x3 neighborhood) of every pixel in the gradient image. The name non-maxima suppression comes from the fact that we eliminate (i.e. set to zero) all gradients except the maximum one in small 3x3 neighborhoods over the entire image.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hysteresis thresholding:** After non-maxima suppression, we could threshold the gradient image to obtain a new binary image which is black in all places except for pixels where the gradient is very high. This kind of thresholding would naively exclude a lot of edges because, in real world images, edges tend to fade in and out along their length. For example, an edge may be strong in the middle but fade out at the two ends.\n",
    "      To fix this problem, Canny edge detection uses** **two thresholds. First, a higher threshold is used to select pixels with very high gradients. We say these pixels have a strong edge. Second, a lower threshold is used to obtain new pixels that are potential edge pixels. We say these pixels have a weak edge. A weak edge pixel can be re-classified as a strong edge if one of its neighbor is a strong edge. The weak edges that are not reclassified as strong are dropped from the final edge map. \n",
    "\n",
    "**<font style = \"color:rgb(255,0,0)\">Note:</font>** According to Wikipedia, the word [hysteresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis) means \"the dependence of the state of a system on its history.\" In thresholding, it is the dependence of the state ( edge / no edge ) of a pixel based on its neighbor.
