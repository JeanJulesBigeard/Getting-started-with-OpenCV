If your friends do not look sufficiently impressed, you can tell them the method is based on the Navier Stokes equation they might have encountered in fluid dynamics!\n",

    "## What is Image Inpainting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Image inpainting is a class of algorithms in computer vision where the objective is to fill regions inside an image or a video.\n",
    "\n",
    "The region is identified using a binary mask, and the filling is usually done by propagating information from the boundary of the region that needs to be filled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common application of image inpainting is restoration of old scanned photos. It is also used for removing small unwanted objects in an image."

    "\n",
    "They bring their ideas to the field and solve the same problem in very interesting and unique ways. An electrical engineer may see an image as a 2D signal and apply the theories of signal processing to solve computer vision problems. On the other hand, a mathematician may see an image as a connected graph and solve computer vision problems using graph theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it isnâ€™t surprising that theories developed for fluid dynamics also make their way into computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image below, our objective is to fill the dark region and obtain an image that looks like the one on the right."

Instead of using the image Laplacian as the estimator of smoothness, the author uses a weighted average over a known image neighborhood of the pixel to inpaint. The known neighborhood pixels and gradients are used to estimate the color of the pixel to be inpainted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a pixel is inpainted, the boundary needs to updated. The author treats the missing region of the image as [level sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_set) and uses the [fast marching method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_marching_method) to update the boundary."
