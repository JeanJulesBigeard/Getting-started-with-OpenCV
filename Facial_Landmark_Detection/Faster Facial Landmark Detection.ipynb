    "Dlib has a very good implementation of a very fast facial landmark detector. However, you sometimes hear people complain that Dlib’s facial landmark detector is slow. Out of the box, it appears to be slow, but that is not because of bad implementation of the Facial Landmark Detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dlib’s facial landmark detector implements a [paper](http://www.csc.kth.se/~vahidk/papers/KazemiCVPR14.pdf) that can detect landmarks in just 1 millisecond! That is 1000 frames a second. You will never get 1000 fps because the landmark detector is not the bottleneck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizing code for speed involves first finding the bottlenecks. Sometimes I get an email from people asking what parameters to choose while training Dlib’s landmark detector to make it faster. Now, that is a wrong place to optimize because even though you can indeed make the landmark detector faster by optimizing training parameters, it will make zero difference to the final product. Even if you make it twice as fast, the code that now runs in 1 millisecond, will run in 0.5 milliseconds after all the optimizations you have done.\n",

    "Facial Landmark Detector algorithms requires the user to provide a bounding box containing a face. The algorithm takes as input the image along with this box and returns the landmarks. The speed of face detection depends on the the resolution of the image because with smaller resolution images, you look for a smaller range of face sizes. The downside is that you will miss out smaller faces, but in many applications we have one person looking at the camera / webcam.\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy way to speed up face detection is to resize the frame. My webcam records video at 720p ( i.e. 1280×720 ) resolution and I resize the image to a fixed height and vary the width accordingly. The bounding box obtained after face detection should be resized back by dividing the coordinates by the scale used for resizing the original frame. This allows us to do landmark detection at full resolution."

We can simply do facial landmark detection based on facial bounding box obtained a few frames earlier. If you do face detection every 3 frames, you can have just sped up landmark detection by almost three times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it possible to do better than using the previous location of the frame ? Yes, we can use object tracking methods to track the location of the face in frames where detection is not done, but in a webcam / selfie application it is an overkill."
