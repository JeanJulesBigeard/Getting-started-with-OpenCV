        "Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) is the task of finding and recognizing license plates in images. Several traffic-related applications, such as detection of stolen vehicles, toll control and parking lot access validation involve vehicle identification, which is performed by ALPR systems. It is a challenging problem due to its potential applicability in the diverse geographical conditions with varying license plate parameters.\n",

        "The ALPR task can be broken into three subtasks that form a sequential pipeline:\n",

        "\n",
        "On one hand, a high recall rate is desired, since any miss detected vehicle having a visible LP leads directly to an overall LP miss detection. On the other hand, high precision is also desirable to keep running times low, as each falsely detected vehicle must be verified by LP detector. \n",
        "\n",
        "Based on these considerations, we will use the YOLOv2 network due to its fast execution (around 70 FPS) and good precision and recall compromise (76.8% mAP over the PASCAL-VOC dataset).\n",
